# Hi, I'm Long ðŸ‘‹

## About Me: 

Thank you for visiting my GitHub. Here's a brief introduction about myself. 

- :man_student: I have a background in Chemical Engineering with a Master's degree from the University of Manchester (U.K.).
- :man_mechanic: Over the years, I've worked across various industries â€”including oil & gas, manufacturing, operations, and healthcareâ€” with all roles geared toward data-driven solutions.
- :microscope: My passion for data is more than just a job; it's a journey of continuous learning and growth.
- :computer: At my current job, Iâ€™m currently building an entire end-to-end data portal and system from the ground up, applying my skills in database design, data modelling, ETL data pipelines, analytics, visualization, and front-end web development.

## My Interests:

- :camera_flash: When I'm not busy cleaning and analyzing data, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking in the Rockies, and capturing the breathtaking beauty of Canada through photography.
- :zap: Fun facts: addicted to coffee :coffee:, obsessed with books :books:, and fanatic about photography :camera:.

## What I'm Learning:

- I code (almost) daily to get better at solving problems. Check out my streak below!
- I mostly learn from books, taking notes with pen and paper (I'm old-school and I know it). I also learn a great deal from brilliant minds on Coursera, YouTube (Harvard's CS50x, freeCodeCamp, StatQuest, to name a few), and Udemy.
- Iâ€™m working on Python-based projects to deepen my data engineering and programming expertise. You can see my work on GitHub.
- Iâ€™m teaching myself web development with Python, Django, and JavaScript stacks, aiming to build dynamic data-driven web applications.
- Iâ€™m very enthusiastic about the cloud-native approach and studying for the AWS SAA-C03 exam.
<!-- - I write about what I learn and my projects on my data blog. Check it out to see what Iâ€™m up to.-->
